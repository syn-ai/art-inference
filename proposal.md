## Project Proposal

We propose to develop an API proxy for ComfyUI art generation that will serve as an intermediary between clients and the ComfyUI instance. This proxy will simplify the process of generating art by dynamically constructing prompts, managing workflows, and providing a flexible API for future UI development.

## Overview

The ComfyUI API Proxy will be a Rust-based application that handles incoming requests, processes them, communicates with the ComfyUI instance, and returns the results to the client. It will dynamically construct prompts from templates, manage workflows, and provide an extensible API for node management and future UI integration.

## Component Breakdown

1. **API Server**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and responses.
2. **Prompt Constructor**: Dynamically builds prompts from templates and input data.
3. **ComfyUI Client**: Communicates with the ComfyUI instance and polls for results.
4. **Workflow Manager**: Manages and stores workflow templates.
5. **Node Registry**: Keeps track of available nodes and their input fields.
6. **Static Drive Poller**: Monitors the static drive for generated art.
7. **Configuration Manager**: Handles application configuration and environment variables.

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up the basic Rust project structure with Tokio for async runtime.
2. Implement the API Server using a framework like Actix-web or warp.
3. Create the ComfyUI Client to communicate with the ComfyUI instance.
4. Develop the Prompt Constructor to dynamically build prompts from templates.
5. Implement the Workflow Manager to handle and store workflow templates.
6. Create the Node Registry to manage available nodes and their input fields.
7. Implement the Static Drive Poller to monitor for generated art.
8. Develop the Configuration Manager for handling environment variables and settings.
9. Integrate all components and implement error handling and logging.
10. Write unit and integration tests for each component.
11. Document the API and create usage examples.

This implementation plan allows for iterative development, where we can start with basic functionality and gradually add more complex features. We can begin by implementing the core API server and ComfyUI client, then add the prompt construction and workflow management features, and finally implement the node registry and UI-related endpoints.
